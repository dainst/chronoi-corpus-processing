    DNEs are "Dateable Named Entities"
    Note: Presumably every named entity can potentially be given a date. These are
    different from temponyms in that they occur in a syntactical context that cannot be occupied
    by a time expression (there exists no substitution with a regular time expression that would
    constitute a well-formed expression).
    We include the basic named entity types of events, persons and locations.

<!--
    We mark occurences of literary references as they generally constitute a different
    temporal frame of reference than the main text and a time tagger might have to distinguish
    occurences of this kind.
    This tag should include any token that marks the beginnig and end of a literary reference.
    (Usually these are marked up as hyphens, but indicaters such as "cf.", "see", etc. should
    also be included.)
    Literary references should be marked up even if they do not contain a temporal expression.
