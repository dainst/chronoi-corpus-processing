# Annotation files

These were used for annotation with the [Oxygen XML Editor](https://www.oxygenxml.com/) using its [Author Mode](https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/21.1/ug-editor/topics/author-editor.html).

To prepare a plain text document for tagging use the script `prepare_tagging.sh`, which will link the  `.css` and `.dtd` files and wrap each line in a `<sentence />`-tag. The css will then be picked up by Oxygen when you switch to the author mode.
