    We mark occurences of literary references as they generally constitute a different
    temporal frame of reference than the main text and a time tagger might have to distinguish
    occurences of this kind.
    This tag should include any token that marks the beginnig and end of a literary reference.
    (Usually these are marked up as hyphens, but indicaters such as "cf.", "see", etc. should
    also be included.)
    Literary references should be marked up even if they do not contain a temporal expression.
