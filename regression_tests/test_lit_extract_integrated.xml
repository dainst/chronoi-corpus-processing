imperial examination. The main purpose of this examination was to select able candidates for specific governmental
positions.[Advanced Level Examination, Chinese Language and Culture, Paper 1A] The imperial examination was established
by the <TIMEX3INTERVAL earliestBegin="+0589" latestBegin="+0589" earliestEnd="+0618" latestEnd="+0618"><TIMEX3 tid="t100010" type="TEMPONYM" value="+0618">Sui dynasty</TIMEX3></TIMEX3INTERVAL> in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="0605">605 AD</TIMEX3> and was later abolished by the <TIMEX3INTERVAL earliestBegin="+1644" latestBegin="+1644" earliestEnd="+1911" latestEnd="+1911"><TIMEX3 tid="t100011" type="TEMPONYM" value="+1911">Qing dynasty</TIMEX3></TIMEX3INTERVAL> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1905">1300 years later</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1905">1905</TIMEX3>.
England had adopted this examination system in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1806">1806</TIMEX3> to select specific candidates for positions in Her Majesty's Civil
Service, modeled on the <TIMEX3INTERVAL earliestBegin="-0079" latestBegin="-0079" earliestEnd="+0730" latestEnd="+0730"><TIMEX3 tid="t100013" type="TEMPONYM" value="+0730">Chinese</TIMEX3></TIMEX3INTERVAL> imperial examination.[Bodde, D., Chinese Ideas in the West] This examination system was
later applied to education and it started to influence other parts of the world as it became a prominent standard (e.g.
regulations to prevent the markers from knowing the identity of candidates), of delivering standardised tests.

Modern era

Civil service

From the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="18" mod="MID">mid 19th century</TIMEX3>, universities began to institute written examinations to assess the aptitude of the pupils.
This is an excerpt from the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1842">1842</TIMEX3> Tripos examination in Cambridge University. As the profession transitioned to the
<TIMEX3INTERVAL earliestBegin="+1601" latestBegin="+1601" earliestEnd="+1918" latestEnd="+1918"><TIMEX3 tid="t100017" type="TEMPONYM" value="+1918">modern</TIMEX3></TIMEX3INTERVAL> mass-education system, the style of examination became fixed, with the stress on standardized papers to be sat by
large numbers of students. Leading the way in this regard was the burgeoning Civil Service that began to move toward a
meritocratic basis for selection in the <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="18" mod="MID">mid 19th century</TIMEX3> in England.

<TIMEX3INTERVAL earliestBegin="+1878" latestBegin="+1878" earliestEnd="+1960" latestEnd="+1960"><TIMEX3 tid="t100020" type="TEMPONYM" value="+1960">British</TIMEX3></TIMEX3INTERVAL> civil service was influenced by the imperial examinations system and meritocratic system of China. Thomas Taylor
Meadows, Britain's consul in Guangzhou, China argued in his Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China,
published in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1847">1847</TIMEX3>, that "the long duration of the <TIMEX3INTERVAL earliestBegin="-0079" latestBegin="-0079" earliestEnd="+0730" latestEnd="+0730"><TIMEX3 tid="t100022" type="TEMPONYM" value="+0730">Chinese</TIMEX3></TIMEX3INTERVAL> empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government
which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the <TIMEX3INTERVAL earliestBegin="+1878" latestBegin="+1878" earliestEnd="+1960" latestEnd="+1960"><TIMEX3 tid="t100023" type="TEMPONYM" value="+1960">British</TIMEX3></TIMEX3INTERVAL> must reform their civil service
by making the institution meritocratic.[Bodde, Derke. "China: A Teaching Workbook". Columbia University.] As early as in
<TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1806">1806</TIMEX3>, the Honourable East India Company established a college near London to train and examine administrators of the
Company's territories in India.[Bodde 2005] Examinations for the Indian 'civil service'- a term coined by the Company –
were introduced in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1829">1829</TIMEX3>.[Mark W. Huddleston, William W. Boyer (1996). The Higher Civil Service in the United States:
Quest for Reform. University of Pittsburgh Press. ISBN 9780822974734.]

In <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="1853">1853</TIMEX3> the Chancellor of the Exchequer William Gladstone, commissioned Sir Stafford Northcote and Charles Trevelyan to
look into the operation and organisation of the Civil Service. Influenced by the ancient <TIMEX3INTERVAL earliestBegin="-0079" latestBegin="-0079" earliestEnd="+0730" latestEnd="+0730"><TIMEX3 tid="t100028" type="TEMPONYM" value="+0730">Chinese</TIMEX3></TIMEX3INTERVAL> <TIMEX3INTERVAL earliestBegin="+0001" latestBegin="+0001" earliestEnd="+0476" latestEnd="+0476"><TIMEX3 tid="t100029" type="TEMPONYM" value="+0476">Imperial</TIMEX3></TIMEX3INTERVAL> Examination,
the Northcote–Trevelyan Report of <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1854">1854</TIMEX3> made four principal recommendations: that recruitment should be on the basis of
merit determined through standardized written examination, that candidates should have a solid general education to
enable inter-departmental transfers, that recruits should be graded into a hierarchy and that promotion should be
through achievement, rather than 'preferment, patronage or purchase'.[Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142.] A Civil
Service Commission was also set up in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="1855">1855</TIMEX3> to oversee open recruitment and end patronage, and most of the other
Northcote–Trevelyan recommendations were implemented <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over some years</TIMEX3>.[Walker, David (2003-07-09). "Fair game". The
Guardian. London. Retrieved 2003-07-09.]

The Northcote–Trevelyan model of meritocratic examination remained essentially stable for <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P100Y">a hundred years</TIMEX3>. This was a
tribute to its success in removing corruption, delivering public services (even under the stress of two world wars), and
responding effectively to political change. It also had a great international influence and was adapted by members of
the Commonwealth. The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act established a similar system in the United States.
